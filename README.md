## Welcome to my GitHub!
I'm currently studying Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University with minors in French and Human-Computer Interaction. Not only do I like learning new programming languages, but I also like learning new languages in general!

### What I'm Working On
- I'm working as Head TA for the course [67-272 Application Design and Development](https://github.com/67272-App-Design-Dev) (a full stack course using Ruby on Rails and React) at CMU right now
- I've just finished an internship as an Technical Consulting Intern doing Application Development at Oracle which ran from the start of the summer and was extended into the fall semester.
