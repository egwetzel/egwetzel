## Welcome to my GitHub!
I'm currently studying Information Systems at Carnegie Mellon University with minors in French and Human-Computer Interaction. Not only do I like learning new programming languages, but I also like learning new languages in general!

### What I'm Working On
- Lately, I have been taking on a couple of web design projects for small businesses in the art world to help them boost their appearances online.
- I have an internship right now (summer 2022) for Youth Enrichment Services, where I get to teach both a coding class and a web development course to students in the Pittsburgh area.
